This Rmd file predicts dissolved CO~2~ (ppm) from instantaneous pH from water samples taken during avoidance trials. Thresholds for dissolved CO~2~ avoidance are estimated from pH using the resulting model.

\
**The pH trend in both chambers.** The two chambers experienced relatively little water exchange across the connecting channel due to the circular chamber design and opposing currents.
However, water mixed uniformly within each chamber, as evidenced by similar pH values in the center of the chamber, immediately next to the exit, and at the gas stone.

\
**CO~2~ avoidance boxplots.** Bighead and silver carp avoided dissolved carbon dioxide at the same threshold level in the small and large tanks (`r mod$method`, Î§^2^ = `r chi2`, p = `r pval`).
Carp avoided pCO~2~ at `r avoidPPM` ppm.\

\
There is not a significant difference in dissolved CO~2~ avoidance thresholds between species or tank size (`r mod$method`, Î§^2^ = `r chi2`, p = `r pval`, Fig 1).
Across all trials in both tanks, bigheaded carp avoided pCO~2~ at `r avoidPPM` ppm.
Previous studies have found multiple species share similar CO~2~ avoidance thresholds (CITATION 17).
This threshold pCO~2~ level was used in CO~2~ conditioning treatments, by reaching an instantaneous pH of approximately `r pHThreshold` by the conditioning midpoint.

In the small shuttle tank, schools of five juvenile untrained bighead (n = 5) and silver (n = 5) carp exhibited CO~2~ avoidance at `r smallCO2` Â± `r smallCO2_SE` ppm (n = 10, mean Â± SE, Table 1) as estimated by instantaneous pH, TA, and temperature in CO2Calc.
Avoidance occurred at `r smallMeasured` Â± `r smallMeasured_SE` ppm (n = 6) as measured from water samples by NDIR probe.
In the large shuttle tank, individual bighead carp (n = 10) exhibited their last CO~2~ avoidance at `r largeBighead` Â± `r largeBighead_SE` ppm (Table 1).
Schools of five silver carp (n = 9) last avoided the increasing chamber at `r largeSilver` Â± `r largeSilver_SE` ppm.
In the large tank, the last avoidance occurred at `r largeBoth` ppm CO~2~ on average for both species, as estimated by pH (S1).
The average pCO~2~ in the increasing chamber was measured at `r largeMeasured` Â± `r largeMeasured_SE` ppm (n = `r largeMeasured_N`) three minutes after the last avoidance.
