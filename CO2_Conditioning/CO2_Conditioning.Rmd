# Results
## Small Tank

pCO~2~ at conditioning midpoint was `r smallMidpoint` ± `r smallMidpoint_SE` ppm. 
pCO~2~ at conditoining endpoint was `r smallEnd`± `r smallEnd_SE` ppm. 

## Large tank
In the large tank, dissolved CO~2~ before trial initiation was 2310 ± 239 ppm for schools trained with CO~2~, and 1459 ± 45 ppm for schools trained with air. 
At the trial endpoint, the dissolved CO2 for carp undergoing conditioning with air was 1494 ± 65 ppm. 
Carp in the CO~2~ treatment (N = 10) were conditioned at `r largeEnd_ppm` ± `r largeEnd_ppm_SE` ppm by the conditioning period endpoint.
