This Rmd file analyzes the time until first exit and first return for bigheaded carp in the small tank.
Mixed ANOVAs and t-tests are computed.
Boxplots for the associated manuscript are generated.

## Results

All trained carp exhibited negative phonotaxis by shuttling out of the sound chamber.
Two untrained schools did not exit the sound chamber within the allotted five minutes of acoustic playback.
Sound was the only predictor that had a significant effect on seconds until first exit (Mixed ANOVA, Î§^2^ = `r soundChisq`, p = `r soundPval`).
Notably on the first day of phonotaxis trials, trained schools initially left the sound chamber in `r day1Trained` s, whereas untrained schools took `r day1Untrained` s to exit (`r day1Method`, df = `r day1DF`, t = `r day1Stat`, p = `r day1Pval`).
There were no differences in time to exit due to training treatment on later sound presentations (Fig SmallBoxplotExit).

The assumptions of no outliers, normality, and homogeneity of variances are met.
A significant result for Box's M-test for Homogeneity of Covariance Matrices is likely due to unequal sample sizes between trained and untrained groups after removal of outliers.
A mixed ANOVA is run noting this violation.

Training with CO~2~ had a marginally significant effect on seconds to return to the sound chamber (Mixed ANOVA, Î§^2^ = `r trainChisq`, p = `r trainPval`).
Presence of the acoustic signal had a highly significant effect on time to return (Î§^2^ = `r soundChisq`, p = `r soundPval`).
Additionally, the number of days since training had a significant effect on time to return (Î§^2^ = `r dayChisq`, p = `r dayPval`).
Notably, there was a significant three-way interaction between training, presence of sound, and the number of days since trial onset (Î§^2^ = `r interactChisq`, p = `r interactPval`).

On the first day of phonotaxis trials, trained schools spent `r day1Trained` s in the quiet chamber before returning to the loud chamber, whereas untrained schools took only `r day1Untrained` s to return (`r day1Method`, df = `r day1DF`, t = `r day1Stat`, p = `r day1Pval`).
One week after training, trained schools spent `r day7Trained` s in the quiet chamber before returning, compared to `r day7Untrained` s for untrained schools (`r day7Method`, df = `r day7DF`, t = `r day7Stat`, p = `r day7Pval`).
There were no differences in time to return to the sound chamber due to training treatment on sound presentations after one week (Fig SmallBoxplotReturn).

**Fig smallboxplotReturn Seconds in the quiet chamber until returning to the sound chamber.** On the first day, trained schools stayed in the quiet chamber for `r day1Trained` s, whereas untrained schools returned after only `r day1Untrained` s (`r day1Method`, df = `r day1DF`, t = `r day1Stat`, p = `r day1Pval`).
On the seventh day, trained schools returned after `r day7Trained` s, compared to `r day7Untrained` s for untrained schools (`r day7Method`, df = `r day7DF`, t = `r day7Stat`, p = `r day7Pval`).
There were no differences in time to return due to training treatment beyond one week after conditioning.

Untrained fish returned to the sound chamber `r untrainedDiff` s faster on the second sound presentation, which occurred on the 4th day after conditioning, than they had during the first presentation, although this difference was not significant (df = `r untrainedDF`, t = `r untrainedStat`, p = `r untrainedPval`).
In contrast, trained fish returned to the sound chamber `r TrainedDiff` s faster than they had for the second sound presentation (df = `r TrainedDF`, t = `r TrainedStat`, p = `r TrainedPval`).
This suggests trained fish may have habituated to the sound stimulus on the second presentation in a way the untrained fish did not.
